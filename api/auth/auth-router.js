    IMPLEMENT
    You are welcome to build additional middlewares to help with the endpoint's functionality.

    1- In order to log into an existing account the client must provide `username` and `password`:
      {
        "username": "Captain Marvel",
        "password": "foobar"
      }

    2- On SUCCESSFUL login,
      the response body should have `message` and `token`:
      {
        "message": "welcome, Captain Marvel",
        "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI ... ETC ... vUPjZYDSa46Nwz8"
      }

    3- On FAILED login due to `username` or `password` missing from the request body,
      the response body should include a string exactly as follows: "username and password required".

    4- On FAILED login due to `username` not existing in the db, or `password` being incorrect,
      the response body should include a string exactly as follows: "invalid credentials".
